The examples were tested on Fedora using the GNU C-Compiler.

The purpose of this collection is to enrich existing documentation with small examples and code snippets. For all functions and there correct definitions checkout the draft of the http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf[ISO/IEC 9899:TC3] standard.
