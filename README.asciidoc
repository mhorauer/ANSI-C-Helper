This C-Helper provides a description of most ANSI-C functions along with small usage examples. This collection is intended for beginners.

WARNING: Unfortunately, many examples are coded in a _dirty_ fashion and need to be re-written. There are many ANSI-C functions missing and some that were deprecated are still there.
