NAME::
errno - number of last error

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <errno.h>

#define errno;
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::
errno is a preprocessor macro that expands to a thread-local (since C11)
modifiable lvalue of type `int`. Several standard library functions indicate
errors by writing positive integers to errno. Typically, the value of errno is
set to one of the error codes listed in <errno.h> as macro constants beginning
with the letter E followed by uppercase letters or digits.

The value of errno is ​`0`​ at program startup, and although library functions
are allowed to write positive integers to errno whether or not an error
occurred, library functions never store ​`0`​ in errno.

Library functions `perror` and `strerror` can be used to obtain textual
descriptions of the error conditions that correspond to the current errno value.

The ISO C standard defines the following symbolic error names:

....
EDOM   - Mathematics argument out of domain of function
EILSEQ - Illegal byte sequence
ERANGE - Result too large
....

POSIX defines the following additional symbolic error names:
